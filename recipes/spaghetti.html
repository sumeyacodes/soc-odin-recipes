    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>(Original recipe yields 8 servings)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese</li>
      <li>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Drain.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and
        onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft and
        translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drain excess oil from the pan; stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned
        salt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss
        to coat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared baking dish. Top with
        1/2 of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of the meat sauce.
        Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle
        with remaining 1 cup mozzarella.
      </li>

      <li>
        Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
